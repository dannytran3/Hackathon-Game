# Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project comes from the classic Dinosaur game that many of us have played when our WiFi is out. We wanted to recreate the nostalgic experience of this simple yet addictive game and add our own twist to it.

Nostalgia Meets Innovation: We were inspired by the nostalgia associated with the Dinosaur game, which Google Chrome displays when there's no internet connection. We saw an opportunity to bring this classic to life with modern web technologies.

Recreating a Classic: The Dinosaur game is a symbol of internet downtime. It's simple, fun, and universally recognizable. By recreating it, we pay homage to this digital icon.

Adding a Hackathon Twist: For the hackathon, we didn't want to settle for a mere clone. We decided to innovate and enhance the game with new features, making it even more engaging and exciting.

Bringing People Together: In a world where we're often glued to our screens, this game serves as a reminder of the days when we had to entertain ourselves during connection outages. It's a lighthearted way to connect with others through shared experiences

# What it does
Our project is an Infinite Side Scroller game that brings unlimited fun to players of all ages. Here's what it offers:

Endless Adventure: The game provides an infinite scrolling landscape, ensuring that players can enjoy an ever-changing and dynamic gaming experience without an endpoint.

Obstacle Dodging: Players take on the role of a character and must navigate through obstacles, jumping over them, and avoiding collisions to keep the game going.

Enjoyable Graphics: We've put effort into making the game visually appealing, with eye-catching graphics that add to the overall enjoyment

Accessible Anytime: You can play the game anytime, whether you have a stable internet connection or not. It's perfect for quick, enjoyable breaks.

# How we built it
We developed our project using the simplicity and power of Vanilla JavaScript, opting for a lightweight and efficient approach. Here's an overview of our development process:

JavaScript at the Core: Our project's foundation is Vanilla JavaScript, utilizing the language's native capabilities to create the game's functionality. This choice allowed us to have full control over the code and optimize its performance.

HTML5 Canvas: To render the game environment and characters, we leveraged HTML5 Canvas, a powerful and versatile HTML element for 2D graphics. This allowed us to create a visually appealing and responsive game.

# Challenges we ran into
During the development of our project, we encountered several challenges, with a primary focus on creating and framing our own sprites:

Sprite Design: Designing unique and visually appealing sprites that fit the theme of our game was a creative challenge. This involved the creation of characters, obstacles, and background elements that are both engaging and cohesive.

Frame Synchronization: Ensuring that the frames of our sprites were correctly synchronized with the game's logic and animations was a key challenge. Achieving smooth and realistic character movements required precise timing.

Sprite Scaling: Adapting the sprites to different screen sizes and resolutions while maintaining visual quality was a challenge. We had to make sure that our game looked great on both small and large screens.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Throughout the development of our project, we achieved several significant accomplishments, and one of the most notable is implementing our creative freedom:

Unique Game Experience: We are proud of creating a game that breaks free from conventions and embraces our creative vision. This allowed us to develop an experience that stands out and offers players something fresh and engaging.

Team Collaboration: We are proud of how our team collaborated to bring our collective creative ideas to life. Each team member's input contributed to the project's success, making it a true reflection of our creative collective.

# What we learned
Throughout the development of our project, we gained valuable insights and learned several lessons, with a special focus on the power of JavaScript:

JavaScript Versatility: We discovered that JavaScript is an incredibly versatile programming language. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, from game development to web application creation, making it a go-to choice for many projects.

Control and Flexibility: JavaScript provides developers with a high level of control and flexibility. We learned how to harness this control to build a game that met our creative vision and technical requirements.

Object-Oriented Approach: We found that an object-oriented approach in JavaScript is a structured way to create and manage game elements. This approach improved code organization and maintenance.

Game Logic Mastery: JavaScript's ability to handle game logic and interactivity was a significant lesson. We learned how to implement player controls, collision detection, scoring systems, and animations effectively.

# What's next for Hackathon Corgi Run?
In the future of "Hackathon Corgi Run," we're excited to embark on an adventure of continuous improvement and expansion. Our immediate plans include the development of "Hackathon Corgi Run 2," which promises to bring a fresh wave of features and excitement to our players. We're committed to enriching the gameplay with additional obstacles, power-ups, and surprises that will keep players engaged and entertained. Enhanced graphics and animations are also on the horizon, ensuring the game remains visually stunning. Moreover, we're exploring the introduction of a multiplayer mode, allowing players to compete with friends and others online, fostering a sense of community around the game. Accessibility across various platforms, bug fixes, and polishing are also part of our roadmap. We're open to player suggestions, valuing the input of our community as we shape the future of "Hackathon Corgi Run." The journey continues, and we're thrilled to have players along for the ride.
